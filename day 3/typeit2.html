        <h1 id="title">Early Wittgenstein</h1>
        <h3>1. Picture Theory of Language:</h3>
        <p>Language functions as a "picture" of reality.
            Sentences mirror facts, with elements in sentences corresponding to elements in the world.
            Meaning arises from this correspondence between language and reality.</p>
        <h3>2. Logical Structure of Language:</h3>
        <p>Emphasis on logical form as the essence of meaning.
            Only propositions that can be logically analyzed are meaningful.
            Nonsense results from attempts to express what cannot be said clearly (i.e., what lies outside the limits of language).</p>
        <h3>3. Limits of Language:</h3>
        <p>Philosophy's task is to clarify language to prevent confusion.
            What can be said at all can be said clearly; whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
            This led to a view that metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic propositions are not expressible in meaningful language.</p>
        <h3>4. Atomism and Logical Positivism:</h3>
        <p>Reality consists of a set of atomic facts, and complex facts are combinations of these.
            Influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the Vienna Circle, in advocating that meaningful statements are either empirically verifiable or logically necessary.</p>

        <h1 id="title">Late Wittgenstein</h1>
        <h3>1. Critique of the Picture Theory:</h3>
        <p>Abandoned the idea that language functions as a picture of reality.
            Introduced the concept of "language games" to illustrate the diverse ways language is used.</p>
        <h3>2. Language Games:</h3>
        <p>Language is a social activity with various functions, governed by rules akin to games.
            Meaning is determined by use within specific contexts and forms of life.
            There is no single essence of language; rather, its meaning is found in its practical use.</p>
        <h3>3. Meaning as Use:</h3>
        <p>The meaning of a word is its use in the language.
            Context and the way language is practiced in daily life determine meaning.</p>
        <h3>4. Private Language Argument:</h3>
        <p>Argued against the possibility of a purely private language, one that is understood by only a single individual.
            Meaningful language requires a public criterion of correctness, grounded in communal use.</p>
        <h3>5. Philosophy as Therapy</h3>
        <p>Philosophy should not aim to solve traditional metaphysical problems but rather to dissolve philosophical confusion.
            Philosophical problems are often the result of misunderstandings of language.</p>
        <h3>6. Forms of Life</h3>
        <p>The concept of "forms of life" highlights that language and meaning are embedded in broader socio-cultural practices.
            Different "forms of life" entail different ways of using and understanding language.</p>
